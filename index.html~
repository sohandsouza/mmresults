			Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which bite
between dusk and dawn. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness at first.
Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.

			<h3>Malaria cases</h3><p>The number of malaria cases globally fell from an estimated 262 million in 2000 (range: 205–316 million), to 214 million in 2015 (range: 149–303 million), a decline of 18%. Most cases in 2015 are
estimated to have occurred in the WHO African Region (88%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region

<h3>Malaria deaths</h3> <p>The number of malaria deaths globally fell from an estimated 839,000 in 2000 (range: 653
000–1.1 million), to 438,000 in 2015 (range: 236,000–635,000), a decline of 48%. Most deaths in 2015 were in
the WHO African Region (90%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (7%) and the WHO Eastern
Mediterranean Region (2%). The malaria mortality rate, which takes into account population growth, is
estimated to have decreased by 60% globally between 2000 and 2015.</p>

<h3>WHO recommendations</h3> <p>International travellers could be at risk of malaria infection in 97 countries around the world, mostly in Africa,
Asia and the Americas.<br>
Prevention of mosquito bites between dusk and dawn is the first line of defence against malaria. Measures to
prevent mosquito bites include sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets, and using protective clothing and
insect repellents. Depending on the malaria risk in the area to be visited, international travellers may also need
to take preventive medication (chemoprophylaxis) prior to, during, and upon return from their travel.</p>

			<h3>Progress</h3>
			<p><strong>Elimination:</strong> An increasing number of countries are moving towards elimination of malaria.
			Whereas only 13 countries were estimated to have fewer than 1000 malaria cases in 2000, 33 countries are
			estimated to have achieved this milestone in 2015.</p>
			<strong>Financing:</strong> Global financing for malaria control increased from an estimated
			US$ 960 million in 2005 to US$ 2.5 billion in 2014.</p>
			<h3>Moving forward</h3>
			<p>To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global
			Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy
			provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and elimination.
			</p><p>
			This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing malaria case
			incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in at least 35
			countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. To achieve these targets,
			annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period
			, from US$ 2.7 billion (current level of
			spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.</p>
